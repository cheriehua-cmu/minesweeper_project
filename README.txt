My final term project for 15-112, Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science.

Project Name:
MINESWEEPER TEACHER

This project is designed to help a beginner learn to play minesweeper.
It finds the probability of there being a mine in the 8 squares
surrounding a board number. Then, when you click a probability tile,
you can see an explanation for the probability. At the end of
the game, you can run the AI to see how the "teacher" would solve
the board.

To run this project, run minesweeper.py.

There are no libraries that need to be installed. Just make sure that
cmu-112-graphics.py is in the same folder.

'p' to show probabilities. 'Left' to go to the previous move for the AI.
'Right' to go to the next move for the AI. 's' to show common 
strategies. Right-click to flag.
